## 🤖 Models Used

The following 6 classification models were implemented and evaluated:

1. **Logistic Regression** - Linear model for classification
2. **Decision Tree Classifier** - Tree-based interpretable model
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** - Instance-based learning
4. **Naive Bayes (Gaussian)** - Probabilistic classifier
5. **Random Forest (Ensemble)** - Ensemble of decision trees
6. **XGBoost (Ensemble)** - Gradient boosting ensemble

|---------------|----------|-----|-----------|--------|----------|-----|
| Logistic Regression | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX |
| Decision Tree | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX |

| Naive Bayes | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX |
| Random Forest (Ensemble) | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX |
| XGBoost (Ensemble) | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX | 0.XXXX |

> **Note**: Replace the `0.XXXX` values with your actual results after running the models on your chosen dataset.

### 📝 Model Performance Observations

| ML Model Name | Observation about Model Performance |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression | [e.g., "Performs well as a baseline model. Good for linearly separable data. Fast training time and interpretable coefficients."] |
| Decision Tree | [e.g., "Prone to overfitting without proper pruning. Provides interpretable decision rules. Feature importance is easily extractable."] |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | [e.g., "Sensitive to feature scaling and curse of dimensionality. Performance depends on optimal k value. Slow prediction for large datasets."] |
| Naive Bayes | [e.g., "Fast training and prediction. Works well with high-dimensional data. Assumes feature independence which may not hold."] |
| Random Forest (Ensemble) | [e.g., "Reduces overfitting compared to single decision tree. Good handling of imbalanced data. Provides robust feature importance."] |
| XGBoost (Ensemble) | [e.g., "Best performing model with highest accuracy. Handles missing values well. Requires careful hyperparameter tuning."] |
